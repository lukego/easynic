# EasyNIC: an easy-to-use host interface for network cards

EasyNIC is the specification of a hacker-friendly interface between a
computer and a network interface card (NIC).

Design goals:
- Make device driver development easy.
- Provide a minimal "high-speed serial port" operating mode.
- Support 100G and beyond (use PCIe bandwidth efficiently.)
- Support optional extensions (in later versions.)

EasyNIC is inspired by the success of RISC-V.
